### Tactical Adjustments

**BUY on Weakness:**
- Nvidia <$145 (add 1% position; capex validation thesis intact)
- AMD <$140 (add 1-2% position; competitive gains accelerating)
- Alphabet <$160 (add 1% position; capex confidence + Siri upside)
- Cameco <$35 (add 1% uranium exposure; supply deficit sustained)
- Micron <$75 (add 1% HBM exposure; supply constraint premium)
- Bitcoin <$65K (add 0.5% allocation; rate cut cycle supportive)

**SELL / TRIM Positions:**
- Palantir >$80 (trim 0.5%; take profits on volatility; valuable company but premium valuation)
- Tesla >$280 (reduce humanoid option premium if stock rallies 20%+; refocus on core auto business)
- Any position that appreciates >30% from entry to take some profits and redeploy

**HOLD / ACCUMULATE:**
- Constellation Energy (into next earnings; nuclear thesis gaining traction; grid expansion capex starting 2026)
- Broadcom (infrastructure multiplier; add on weakness <$180)
- Intuitive Surgical (quality at premium; steady compounder; no changes)

## RISK FACTORS & MITIGATION (UPDATED)

### Key Risks

1. **AI Capex Pullback (Revised Confidence: ↓ MEDIUM):** Capex spending fails to deliver ROI; competitive intensity forces spending slowdown
   - *Mitigation:* Alphabet reaffirmation reduces this risk; focus positioning on infrastructure (semiconductors, energy) less exposed to spending pullback

2. **Energy Demand Shortfall (Revised Confidence: ↓ LOW):** Operator commitments fail to materialize; demand growth slower than expected
   - *Mitigation:* Operator commitments now contractual; demand certainty increased; SMR pilot validation path opening

3. **Regulatory Headwinds (Stable: MEDIUM):** Crypto regulation worse than expected; AI regulation constraining growth; nuclear construction delays
   - *Mitigation:* Stablecoin framework finalized; SEC transition to favorable stance; nuclear bipartisan support sustained; diversify geographically

4. **Semiconductor Oversupply (Revised Confidence: ↓ MEDIUM):** Fab capacity exceeds demand by 2027-2028; pricing pressure
   - *Mitigation:* Advanced nodes stay tight through 2027; HBM supply-constrained through 2027-2028; focus on memory and AI-specific accelerators; foundry ASP discipline maintained

5. **Macro Recession (Stable: MEDIUM):** Economic slowdown reducing enterprise IT spend and manufacturing reshoring
   - *Mitigation:* Energy sector benefits from data center demand even in downturn; robotics benefits from labor shortage; defensive allocation 32% in broad market/bonds

6. **Space AI Overhype (New Risk: MEDIUM):** Federal executive order doesn't translate to material revenue growth; contracts delayed
   - *Mitigation:* Early-stage risk; monitor contract awards and funding rounds; limited direct exposure currently; watch for IPO opportunities

### Hedges (UPDATED)
- Maintain 5-10% core bond allocation (treasury ladder 2-5 year maturities) for rate-sensitive hedge and economic downturn protection
- Small position in defensive names (consumer staples 2%, utilities 2%) for macro downturn protection
- Diversify across geographies (TSMC for Taiwan exposure, SK Hynix for Korea exposure, ASML for Dutch EU play via semiconductor thesis)
- Crypto allocation (9%) provides non-correlated asset class hedge against equity drawdowns
- Robotics allocation provides "staflation" hedge (benefits from labor cost inflation despite soft economic growth)

## CONCLUSION

The February 21, 2026 market recovery is justified by concrete catalysts: Alphabet's capex validation, Apple's Siri 2.0 positioning, Space AI federal executive order, and energy operator commitments moving demand from forecast to contract. The thematic investment thesis strengthens across all five pillars with elevated conviction most pronounced in **Energy** (primary overweight) and **Semiconductors** (HBM opportunity).

Rather than broad rotation out of tech, this brief recommends **selective repositioning within tech themes**—concentrating in supply-constrained segments (Memory/HBM, Energy, Nuclear), riding the on-device AI inflection (Apple), and maintaining Nvidia core while rotating into AMD for competitive upside.

**Portfolio Shift:** Increase Energy allocation from 20% to 24% (primary trade); increase Robotics from 12% to 14%; increase Crypto from 7% to 9%; maintain AI at 26% with selective concentration on Nvidia/AMD/Broadcom. These adjustments reflect elevated conviction driven by structural demand certainty, supply constraints, and multi-year visibility.

**Key Takeaway:** Move from January's fear-driven underweight to February 21's conviction-driven overweight on Energy and Hardware semiconductors. The secular trends remain intact; catalysts are accelerating; valuations are attractive after correction. Concentrate capital in themes with supply-constrained dynamics (Energy, HBM Memory) and new growth vectors (Space AI, on-device AI, robotics production ramp).
