## THEME 1: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI & ML)

### Market Catalysts (Last 2 Weeks)

**Negative Pressures:**
- Goldman Sachs indicates hyperscaler capex growth will peak in 2026 and decelerate (AI spending at 92% of operating cash flows—above dot-com bubble levels)
- SaaS sector sell-off accelerated by concerns about "vibe coding" and AI models reducing software moat dependency
- Market rotation away from high-growth tech into cyclical assets (utilities, energy, value stocks)

**Positive Catalysts:**
- Enterprise software platforms (ServiceNow, Salesforce) showing strong AI monetization pathways
- ServiceNow's "Now Assist" AI suite hit $600M ARR and tracking to $1B by end of 2026
- Emergence of "agentic AI" as dominant architectural pattern—favors integrated platforms with deep data unification

### Stock-Level Analysis

#### ServiceNow (NOW)
- **Current Valuation:** Forward P/E 24x | Forward P/S 6.5x
- **Recent Move:** Down significantly in SaaS correction
- **Thesis:** AI agents need unified, clean data; NOW's ITSM/HR/service integration makes it ideal orchestration layer
- **Conviction:** **HIGH** — Recent acquisitions (Armis, Veza) add visibility and rights layers; Control Tower positions company as agentic AI platform
- **Target Range:** $130–$150 (based on 28–30x forward P/E, justified by agentic AI upside)

#### Salesforce (CRM)
- **Current Valuation:** Forward P/E 13.5x | Forward P/S 3.5x
- **Recent Move:** Deeply discounted relative to historical multiples
- **Thesis:** Data 360 + Informatica acquisition = master data management platform; critical for enterprise agentic AI
- **Conviction:** **HIGH** — Trading at distressed valuation despite structural AI tailwinds; Informatica integration unlocks legacy data
- **Target Range:** $230–$260 (based on 18–20x forward P/E, normalized for AI revenue mix)

#### Alphabet (GOOGL/GOOG)
- **Current Valuation:** Forward P/E ~28x | Facing capex guidance pressure
- **Thesis:** Gemini momentum continues; loss of search share risk overstated given AI search monetization
- **Conviction:** **MAINTAIN** — Near-term pressure from capex narrative, but Google's AI revenue contribution growing
- **Target Range:** $155–$175 (cyclical trading range pending H2 capex deceleration catalyst)

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **ServiceNow NOW Assist ARR:** Tracking toward $1B+ (growth inflection point)
- **Enterprise AI adoption rates:** # of companies deploying agentic AI in production
- **SaaS Rule of 40 players:** Monitor which SaaS names benefit from AI revenue acceleration
- **Cloud AI revenue as % of total:** Microsoft Azure AI, Google Cloud AI, Amazon Bedrock adoption curves

### 2026 Outlook
- **H1 2026:** Continued rotation pressure; SaaS valuations may compress further as capex concerns dominate narrative

- Nuclear energy gaining policy support as "baseload AI power"
- Energy sector benefiting from broader market rotation away from tech

### Segment-Specific Analysis

#### Traditional Energy (Oil/Gas)
- **Macro:** Geopolitical stability premium in crude; natural gas pricing recovered from 2022–2023 lows
- **Catalyst:** LNG export constraints supporting domestic gas prices through capex cycle
- **Conviction:** **MAINTAIN at 6/10** — Tactical tailwinds, but structural headwinds from energy transition remain

- **Allocation:** 2–3% of thematic portfolio to uranium ETFs (URA, URNM) or direct uranium miners (Cameco CCJ)

#### Renewables & Grid Infrastructure
- **Thesis:** AI capex driving utility capex cycle; solar/wind + battery storage = grid capacity play
- **Key Stocks:** Nextera Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK), Dominion Energy (D)
- **Conviction:** **MAINTAIN at 7/10** — Secular tailwinds, but near-term macro volatility in utilities sector
- **Monitor:** Fed rate expectations; utility valuations highly sensitive to 10-year Treasury yields

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Uranium spot prices:** Current $100–$110/lb range; target $120–$140/lb on structural demand
- **U.S. electricity generation growth:** Monitor grid operator forecasts for data center power demand (GW-scale new capacity needed)
- **Nuclear reactor construction timelines:** SMR commercialization updates (NuScale, TerraPower)
- **Energy sector valuations:** P/E vs. broader market (relative value opportunity)

### 2026 Outlook
- **H1 2026:** Continued energy sector strength from rotation + geopolitical premium
- **H2 2026:** Risk of energy underperformance if recession fears spike, but AI power narrative likely offsets
- **Conviction Level:** **MAINTAIN at 7.5/10** overall; **RAISE uranium to 8/10**

## KEY RISKS & MONITORING POINTS

### Macro Risks
- **Recession fears spike:** Risk-off sentiment could pressure all risk assets; particularly vulnerable: Crypto, High-growth SaaS
- **Fed rate expectations shift:** Utilities/Energy particularly sensitive; Crypto rallies on rate cuts
- **Geopolitical escalation:** Could support Energy but pressure Robotics/China-exposed Tech

### Sector-Specific Risks
- **Hyperscaler capex disappointment:** If Amazon/Google/Microsoft guidance disappoints, Infrastructure stocks could correct 15–20%
- **AI monetization delays:** SaaS AI revenue growth must accelerate to justify continued positions
- **Mining profitability collapse:** If electricity costs spike or bitcoin prices drop, miners face compression

### Company-Specific Risks
- **Seagate execution:** Supply chain disruption, customer destocking, or capex pullback could derail thesis
- **ServiceNow/Salesforce adoption slowdown:** Agentic AI adoption must accelerate to justify upside targets

**Action Items for Portfolio Manager:**
- [ ] Increase SaaS allocation to 30% (weighted toward NOW, CRM)
- [ ] Increase Infrastructure to 25% (maintain Seagate overweight, add WDC on dips)
- [ ] Add 2–3% uranium exposure via ETF
- [ ] Reduce Crypto to 10%; trim miners, maintain BTC core position
- [ ] Monitor weekly: Seagate supply commentary, ServiceNow AI adoption data, macro sentiment shifts

**Next Review Date:** April 15, 2026 (post-earnings season for key holdings)
